A repo containing python codes as solutions for jorgegonzales' beginner-projects repository. See [here](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects).

You can also use this if you want as a reference if you're up for a challenge of recreating one of the programs inside the repository.

I'll add more programs here soon! Cheers!
